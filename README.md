# unity-theme-toolkit
Got a theme for the Unity Desktop? Need some small army of computerized elves to install it? Look no further!
OK, well *maybe* there *aren't* computerized elves, but there is a nifty little POSIX SH script that does it all for you!
**unity-theme-toolkit includes:**
- a check to make sure that unity is installed
- a dash icon installer
- an icon set installer
- a theme installer
- *not* a small army of computerized elves (sadly)
- and a basic Unity theme template

**Go crazy-nuts! Make cool stuff!**
More information can be had-ed over on the [Wiki](/videotoaster/unity-theme-toolkit/wiki).
